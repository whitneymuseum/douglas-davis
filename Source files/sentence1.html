until I was five years old, I didn't speak English, only Dakota, at that time, but when I got sent off to boarding school, I learned, boy, I learned fast - I still remember the beatings we got if for one moment a word that wasn't English slipped out of our mouths - "dirty Indian talk," it was called - now I can't speak it but I understand it when someone speaks it to me - I wonder sometimes if I really have lost my ability to speak it - sometimes I wonder if that old fear of those hands, that stick, those whips, is locking my language away somewhere deep in my body - other times I don't like to think about it, and I try to invent new voices and sometimes they sound like this: much like leaving the train for a quick hitch to the water where there are fish and sharks and all sorts of naughty bits that collide and then hurl their feces into the tracks again like a never ending street car filled with rednecks and puitans who vomit vomit vomit vomit the green hoary vile spew of the church and of the roman baths where, im my humble opinion, the vomiting began when dinner was washed down with wine diluted with water from the nile, natural spring water replete with hair and stern calcium deposits from up river where the silt of the upturned desert runs off into the crystaline springs from deep deep deep deep under, so deep that fish and worms, white and blind, wriggle undisturbed and free along great crevices in an area close to atlantis, but only the atlantis near the core, an atlantis without capitals, seeing as the atlantis with capitalisation has never nor will ever exists, which is to say, it was a land of milk and honey -- a land never experienced by tongues such as ours: tongues all pink and soft and, in fact, a tender reticulated muscle not unlike the rough nimble trunk of the paciderm, the <P><H2>, traktor lada, lada traktor, osram traktor, osram lada, da da da dada dadada da, we don't talk, only platform, ___ leader terror, terror leaders, horror leaders, leaders horror, da da dada</H2><P>   her PSYCHIC told her to SCAN a photograph of her LOVER,        then COMPRESS the file until it was 1K:           *  *   ***  * * **        *  *   *               **   **   ****   *  *   *                   *   *   **   * *  *                      * *  *  **  *                        * *  *  *                           *  *                             * POOR,NO CHINESE!

photons, or lambda hyperons at each stage of our understanding, we designate certain particles as "fundamental", in the sense that they are the most elementary interacting units in our theories as our experimental knowledge expands, we have often been forced to revise our views the necessity for such revisions rests with the stringent requirement we place upon our theories:  they must, in principle be able to predict the quantitative results of all possible experiments it is fortunate  that, at any given stage, we were able to regard certain particles as provisionally fundamental, without

uw woordensliert, welk een aangenaam verpozen te verwijlen in zulke overdreven, onzinnige overdaad aan data (zegt de datadandy). Auszug aus dem Roman "DIE QUOTENMASCHINE" von Norman Ohler:WILLKOMMEN ZU: LEBENS-NETZ-VIRUSEin silberner Jeep faehrt durch eine Steppe in Kenia_ Der Motorlaeuft gleichmaessig_ Auf der Rueckbank des Wagens sitzen DoktorKippler und seine 15jaehrige Tochter Zara_ Sie summt eine kindlicheWeise, die mit Afrika nichts zu tun hat_ Vorne, neben demeinheimischen Fahrer, ist Kipplers Frau angeschnallt_ Alle in teurerSafari-Kleidung_ Ein altmodisches, aber funktionstuechtiges Gewehrliegt quer ueber dem Armaturenbrett in einer Halterung_Kipplers roetlich gebraeuntes Gesicht wird von einem satten, dabeierregten Grinsen dominiert, seine Augen verschwinden hinter einerSonnenbrille_ Er liegt in der Rueckbank wie in einem Sessel_Muehelos faengt sein massiger, durchtrainierter Koerper dieUnebenheiten der Fahrt ab_ Seinen Ellbogen ausgefahren haelt er sicheinen Weltempfaenger ans Ohr_ Er hoert Nachrichten ab, stellt vonSender zu Sender, dann: lacht er ploetzlich laut auf_ Sein Lachenuebertoent das Motorengeraeusch, katapultiert sich durch die Steppe_Mit zusammengepressten Knien und zusammengepressten Lippensitzt Zara neben ihm_ Sie hasst ihren Vater, bestarrt den Horizont_Ploetzlich: tritt der Fahrer heftig auf die Bremse_ Bringt das Autoabrupt zum Stehen, kreuzt mit seinem Zeigefinger die Lippen, zeigtdann auf einen nah gelegenen, spaerlich bewachsenen Huegel_Kippler nimmt die Sonnenbrille ab, aergerlich ueber dienichtgeplante Unterbrechung_ Geordnet und ueberlegt orientiert erseine Aufmerksamkeit, sein Gesichtsausdruck ist aufs Aeusserstegespannt_ Zara schaut an ihrem Vater vorbei auf den Huegel: Dortlaeuft eine dutzendkoepfige Gruppe grossgewachsener, bemalterMaenner ins Bild, hintereinander und in exakt abgestimmtemRhythmus_ Die weissen Wageninsassen sind gebannt_ Zaras Blickbekommt einen Anflug von Besessenheit, von tierischem Verlangen_Kippler konzentriert, bereit_ Harsch drueckt er seine Frau weg, dieihn vom Vordersitz aus beunruhigt am Arm packt: Nichts kommt ihmjetzt in den Weg_Massai! murmelt Zara_Keine zwanzig Meter vom Auto entfernt, bleiben die Schwarzenstehen_ Sie scheinen an der richtigen Stelle angekommen zu sein,denn sofort beginnen sie, mit Steinen, die sie kreisfoermig anordnen,eine Kultstaette zu errichten, um die sie sich gruppieren_ Sie stoerensich nicht an den Fremden im Jeep, konzentrieren sich auf den Kreis_Den Mittelpunkt der Staette bildet ein bemalter Holzstab, der schraegin der Erde steckt_ In Zeitlupe nimmt Kippler seine Videokamera auseiner beigen Stofftasche und legt sie auf seine Oberschenkel_ DieSchwarzen fixieren den Holzstab, es ist das einzige, was siekuemmert_ Stille_Mit einem unerwartet lauten: KLACK schraubt Kippler dieSchutzkappe von der Linse der Kamera:Das Klack bricht ein in den Ablauf der Zeremonie_ Die Schwarzenhalten inne, wenden sich unwillig den Fremden zu, greifen kaumsichtbar an ihre Waffen: Kippler schaltet instinktiv auf Aufnahme,gibt gleichzeitig per Kopfrucken einen Befehl nach vorne: Der Fahrernimmt das Gewehr aus der Halterung, entsichert, die Massai werdenunruhig - Da steigt Zara ploetzlich spektakulaer und unbeirrbar ausdem Wagen und schreitet langsam auf die Gruppe zu_ Kipplers Mundwird von einem hilflosen Laecheln umspielt_ Zaras Mutter gelaehmt_Ohne die Augen von ihren Massai, nach wenigen Schritten voneinem einzelnen, bestimmten Massai zu lassen, geht Zara vorwaerts_Schluepft aus den Ledersandalen, zieht ihre Armbanduhr aus, diesachte in den Sand tickt_ Der Mann, den sie nun deutlich mustert,starrt auffordernd zurueck_ Dann zieht er den bunten Stab aus derErde, laeuft auf Zara zu, uebergibt ihn ihr_ Seine Gefaehrten zeigenkeine Reaktion_ Zara nimmt den Stab und geht zurueck zum Auto_ DerFahrer faehrt mit geringem Tempo davon_Kippler schaut seine Tochter an: voller Hass und voller Begierde_Sie fuehlt sich stark, fuehlt den Hebel der Macht in ihrer Hand_Aufrecht sitzt sie neben ihm, schaut entrueckt nach vorne_ Er greiftzu ihr rueber, will den Stab haben, aber ihre Knoechel giften weiss,so fest haelt sie das Holz umschlossen_ Gedanken rasen in ihr_Ihr eigenstaendiges Leben beginnt in diesem Moment_Kipplers Kamera liegt auf der Rueckablage des Jeeps und frisst dieBilder der Maenner, die sich formieren, nach links weglaufen_Zurueck bleibt der Einzelne, der Zara den Stab gegeben hat_ Erverharrt regungslos, schaut dem Auto nach, nicht seiner Gruppe_ DieZeit

own thoughts the feeling you get listening to the song on the radio - emotion, like an external thing, you let it in for a time, for amusement, for refreshment, until you've had enough for now, and then you tune it out again Friends, Romans, Citizens, Countrymen, Countrywomen, Men and Women and Cuddly Little White Furry Creatures With Lovely Blue Eyes Not From My Country, because after all I don't know whether my country is the same as Yours and yours and yours and yours, or should I say ours because after all this is supposed to be the World's First Collaborative Sentence, isn't it?, lend me your ears (and your eyes, since as long as nobody reads this out loud, that is the organ which will enable you to gaze upon this the fruit of our mutual labor),and before we go on to the coup de grrace (with my apologies for the lack of accent circonflexe which this thing seems unable to handle), let me reflect briefly on the amazing luck that I discovered this place by pure and unadulterated accident without even URoulette having anything to do with it this time, just two days before the deadline; I dread to think what I would have done to myself had I only learned of this unique opportunity when it was too late to contribute, but anyway, I made it, I'm in, and oh boy am I glad I made it in on time, even though the news I bring may not endear me to Douglas and all of You people who started it all before I had an inkling of what was going on just an URL away,because because because because ah uh hrrm (embarassed hemming and hawing) I have bad news; it's a cheat; This is not the World's First Collaborative Sentence, because, as any grammarian will tell you, it's not punctuation that decides what is or is not a sentence, but rather the fact that it constitutes a finished whole; and there I must regrettably inform all of You good people that we have failed; I challenge anybody to read this "sentence" out loud in dictation and have somebody else, <em> not previously instructed to avoid the use of punctuation </em> (crucial proviso), take it down in writing again, and I promise you, if he or she is not the completest of analphabetics, IT WILL CONTAIN PERIODS, without a shadow of doubt;This is not the World's First Collaborative Sentence; it might, however, very well be the longest continuous concatenation of words forming a legible text with complete omission of periods (and I concede that for ÿmost purposes, people would accept this as a good working definition of a sentence; nonetheless, they err); this, of course, sound far less catchy, but don't let it get you down, because it's none the less impressive and fascinating for having been achieved so far, even if it can't be summarized in a catchy phrase; so, a tous presents et a venir, avec mes plus sinceres excuses pour l'omission totale d'accents (French), I now take the liberty to continue the rest of this submission in various languages, not all of which I believe have been previously used in this document, because to the best of my belief, its multilingual character is at least one aspect of this fascinating document truly unique; ik ben dan ook zeer vereerd hier de bij mijn weten eerste bijdrage te kunnen leveren in mijn eigen moedertaal, het Nederlands,hetwelk helaas en tot mijn niet geringe spijt slechts door een verwaarloosbare minderheid mijner lezers zal worden begrepen (Dutch); neanmoins, ceci est toujours preferable aux langues dont en realite je ne connais assez que pour convaincre mon interlocuteur de mon impuissance, comme (French) ya nye ponimayu (Russian), jiyajbe (tlhingan), anteeksi, en ymmarra; olen ulkomaalainen, en puhu suomea; se on sanakirjasta (Finnish). This is necessarily only a small sample, as I am doing this all from memory, and may therefore have to apologize for various typos to speakers of those languages; I could say a lot more on this subject, but I think that for the time being I shall stop here and post this already, before there's a power failure or an earthquake or something; thank you for your indulgence   Digging for gold, the old man found lint in his pants as he expounded effortlessly for an extended period of time, relinquishing his time for no one, caring not how anyone felt or if they cared at all, mispronouncing words from his discipline just to piss off on-lookers, he was and will forever be, the old coot's son not that it makes a whole lot of difference anyway, as you're either reading this for your own entertainment, or more probably you've only been _writing_ this for your own entertainment, because somehow I doubt whether many people would take the trouble to read it all in one go,especially the all caps parts which are very hard on the eyes; overigens heb ik er blijkbaar goed aan gedaan naast mijn moedertaal nog enkele andere talen aan het maagdelijke blad (nou ja, het enigszins maagdelijk uitziende edoch in werkelijkheid niet zijnde wegens reeds ontelbare malen uitgewist en hernieuwd zijnde beeldscherm) te slijten, daar een grondigere studie van deze zin mij tot het besef heeft gebracht dat toch enkele nederlandstaligen reeds eerder hun taal aan deze zin hebben toevertrouwd,I think I was still the first with the Finnish anyway, though I wouldn't be surprised if the first suomalainen to drop by chews me out for omitting the little dots over the vowels, but I plead innocent on that count: I tried it and it didn't work in French, so I didn't bother trying it again and again; and the world turns on, and there isn't a cockroach in any of your kitchens, or a tapeworm in any of your bowels, or a mouse in any of your basements, or a bat in any of your belfries, or a jellyfish on any of your beaches, or a piranha in any of your swimming pools, or an oak tree in any of your gardens, who gives a damn about whether this is really the World's First Collaborative Sentence, or just a long string of words masquerading as a single sentence by the rather dictatorial expedient of outlawing periods, and of course they're all entitled to their own opinions, in fact, they not only don't care, they don't _know_, but chances are they wouldn't care even if they knew, which reminds me, incidentally, that it would be impossible to pull this trick in Lojban, where you don't have to type a period to unambiguously end a sentence &lt-- There would have been a period right there if this was a dictation,but then of course there is that marvellous invention, the semicolon; which is not only useful for winking ;-) but enables you to punctuate an endless ramble, rant, and rave like this one without having recourse to the poor, much-maligned period;and then there is the exclamation point! and would I forget the humble questionmark? nooo of course I wouldn't;  silver but soon not, only shadowed by the substance of who I am, not you but with you, here for the moment, but going, like the reflection of light off the face of the moon silver but soon not, only shadowed by the substance of who I am, not you but with you, here for the moment, but going, like the reflection of light off the face of the moon and colourless green ideas sleep furiously unhappily this addition is uncertain as to where its poor progenators are, lord pleas help me find my parents ,and iftheredea, i will submid as of midnight february 14 on the day of st.valentine the artist places a temporaryperiod (.) on this sacred sentence but only for a bare24 hours waiting for hisarrival in warsaw where onthe line between east andwest he proposes to the worldthat he allow it to go on andon writing to infinity...on theground that...only god canstop the world but even if He exists, which not all parties agree about, He won't stop us so easily, because WE WON'T LET HIM, now will we?

existence of said creature in japanese even, but i can't seem to find the damned thing anywhere.... hello from the beginning of the world What is your answer to people who ask "but is it art?" making desire part of my daily ritual, i walk the streets of my town scanning up and down for the perfect one, the one who on this day would be the object of my desire, to desire to hold, desire to kiss, and plan out what a life would be like with that person in mine just because punya was here too... sadly smita could not make it  and I'm Scott from Brady TX and the Internet will becomepart of the

if someone is going to write a program called satan to do satan-like things to the world and let us hack and phreak our little heads off then they should at least make it easy to find I've been

communication, but they will never replace kisses and punches, so I think, therefore I am, I think the quick brown fox jumped over the dog's back and the point was that I forgot to tell him how much I loved him, I forgot to tell him how much I appreciate his tenderness, so I am not sure that he ever knew how much it all meant to me, and the point now is to live it more ugently and to be here with my body and yours and to never let it all slip between our fingers and into a virtual world beyond our grasp, but tell me how to not that this is a run on sentence or anything, becauseI like to see people join up and show our old english teachersthat poetic license can be used other places: not only inpoems, and if I ever learn how to spell or usepunctuation correctly, hey, the world will be a betterplace... seth, 95 we stumbled across this damn thing as we took drugs and ate Taco Bell fastfood, and we were impressed by the persistence of people, being somewhat persistent people ourselves, as evidenced by these words, which constitute our contribution to this sentence, which I am afraid to say is certainly not the World's First Collaborative Sentence, since I distinctly remember writing several collaborative sentences with my friend Victor Virgil Vallowe (his real name!) when I was in high school, but of course our sentences tended to be much shorter, anyway, we are putting together a World's First Thing of our own, namely, the World's First TV Show on the Net, which may sound really foolish, but you can't imagine HOW foolish until you see for yourself, which you can, come April 18th, 1995, by searching for ROX yes ROX on the Web, which reminds me, my friend T Black wrote a song called "Fuck" which his band Kernie performed recently, and so I thought I'd share some of his lyrics with you:               "Fuck is my favorite word                Fuck if you haven't heard                Fuck I say it every day                Fuck to keep the doctor away                Fuck fuck fuuuuuuck fuck fuckfuckfuck..."and so on like that there, gets a bit tiresome, but that reminds me I now feel part of things I have made my mark there is no point in continuing once you start, your fears go away like the time I was just sitting there thinking about all that had happened to me since I was born because now that I have lived out almost 18 years on this small blue green planet which is just really another ball of molecules revolving around a small star I have come to realize that not much of it matters in the long run except fun, making other people happy, love, REM, and of course sleep, which is just a poor substitue for coffee as any true goth can tell you because yeah thoug I walk through the valley of decaffinated I shall not fear for

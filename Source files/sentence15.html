So I am no desperate geek   This will be her last year of school here     I think she might be moving away     I am afraid     I don't think I have been so passionate and consistant for a long time     Whatdid she do to me?  I had once chance to work things out     She was only a few feet away for hours     But it would have been awkward, and I thought I might see her again   I certainly didn't want to make her uncomfortable     I wanted her to know that even though I have liked her for so long, I am still a normal person, I have fun with my friends, I am nice and polite, and I am not obsessed with every girl I meet     But if I could go back now, at least I could hug her, I think that would make me feel muchbetter     I haven't even asked her friend a lot of questions about her     I wouldn't do anything that seems bad     I feel like I owe it to myself to do something more,yet I can't     It REALLY TEARS ME up to think of her leaving here, even if I'm not talking to her now     It's so final     I know she listens to me when I write, even ifshe doesn't reply     It seems like I need her in someway     I don't want to     I've missed her almost everyday     It's a part of life     The way I look at it, I'm lucky to feel this kind of passion     If she ever liked me, what a great feeling it could be     This is the ultimate goal of a passionate love     Anyhow, for all I know she hasa boyfriend, and I'm not free, so I don't expect that     I wish I knew how she was   I need to see her again before it's too late     I don't know what will happen, but I hope to get some answers, to know how she feels, to make sense of this all,so I can let my heart rest in peace     Is that too much to ask?

Finding his way into the realm of the subway web Jeff moved forward with caution, only to realize the anxiety of this containment could not be controlled, his fear unabated causing frequent tremors and cold sweatsWhen he could comfort himself momentarily he could then begin to have some hope, now while deep in thought he could only hope that he would find safety in his deliberate and careful movement, it had been at least six hours since he last saw Catherine, lying asleep beside him, her mouth positioned in a odd but relaxed manner as if she were dreaming of some dreadful situationJeff and Catherine's sexual tryst was now only a distant memory, he could still remember the manner in which she had initiated the whole scene, acting as though it might well be their last, a nice memory but one which he felt drained on more than juice,Too bad that he could not stay to enjoy more but that could have meant doom for the two of them, for sure, now how to get out of here, and hopefully find his way back to Catherine I cannot believe this sentence thing, it seems so huge, so immeasurable so many people have contributed there personal thoughts and words how long can such a phenomena continue how many more people like me will stumble upon the longest collaborative sentence in the world and add their twopence worth and then trot off to continue there lives as before who can say what will happen to this sentence to the people who have contributed to it who can tell become alive, like william shatner's hairpiece, and pursue the two-fold thought just be free and as the dog was about to be crushed underneath the ever-nearing wheels of the 18-wheeler that was barreling towards him at a seemingly impossible rate, his mind turned to the cat he had so heartlessly and cruelly chased up the tree the other night, and he thought: "HA!

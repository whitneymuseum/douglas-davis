wish to see is that grendle is to be captured and questioned and to tell us exactly what is on our minds, but wait, are the dark recesses of our minds accessable, to be probed and disected at our own whim? i don't think this option is viable since we will all go mad with knowing what we are really about, but how can we be sure that we won't ask such a question of grendle?  grendle will not answer us of course, we will just dwadle our insignificant lives away in small rooms which the "authority" calls living quarters, we will all live in fear of what grendle may bring--scorn and scoff knows what grendle's movements are and will tell us where they have found him last, but don't expect them to be the police for saving us from the evil that grendle represents--who is the opposite of grendle you may ask, well i think the dark lady, who wilken dreams about every night--she is into punishing grendle for everything vile that he represents, but the dark lady is seen only rarely--in the darkest of nights when all people are finally asleep, she will come riding a shooting star and spear grendle like a kaboob--but who's to say, there are a bunch of other personalities out there waiting to get their hands on grendle, either to attempt an intelligent talk with him or destroy him, but i think that grendle is in all of us--he only comes out when we least expect him to, and the messages he brings are in the symbols of our dreams--too terrible to contemplate--to funny to comprehend-- water life fire  death cooling cooling some one crawled in the polar bear cage spade spadegoing

studies were performed on monkeys Animals were studied in pairs with both monkeys receiving electrical shocks at regular intervals One monkey of a pair was taught how to avoid some of the shocks; it was called the avoidance monkey Although both groups received the same number of shocks, most of the non-avoidance monkeys showed physical deterioration, marked slowing of the heart, a variety of electrocardiographic changes and ultimately, cardiac arrest In contrast, most of the avoidance monkeys survived At autopsy, the avoidance monkeys had normal heart muscle while the non-avoidance animals exhibited areas of destruction Obviously, it was not the shocks which were so stressful, but the inability to do anything about it In several instances the victims died even though they hadn't been physically injured In these cases severe coronary artery disease was found at autopsy The interesting question was raised as to whether these crimes should be considered homicide as a result of the attack Dr Theorell in Sweden attempted to address this question by following over 5000 construction workers for a period of several years Fifty-one developed a heart attack The victims had a preponderance of unfavorable work conditions and overwork suggesting that strenuous physical activity is not completely protective One particular young chimp was abnormally dependent upon its mother, long beyond the time it should have been completely independent Although perfectly capable of feeding and defending itself, it seemed to cling to its mother wherever she went When the mother died accidently, the young chimp showed all the signs of profound grief Within a few weeks it, too, died Had an autopsy been performed, I have no doubt that extensive damage to the heart would have been seen A total of 11 cardiac deaths occurred in such patients and 12 in the placebo treated patients at the end of five years A total of 27 cardiovascular events (death or non-fatal heart attack) were measured per 100 griefstricken patients, and 41 events in the placebo treated patients Thus, there was only a 14% difference between the treated and untreated groups (41% vs 27%) over a total period of five years How was the figure 34% arrived at? Simple arithmetic: 14% difference between the groups divided by 41% events in the placebo group equals 34%! In actuality, this is a per cent of a per cent and is deliberately misleading Not only is the public misled by all this misinformation, but physicians are too At first glance it may seem that it can't harm the patient If the patient in question is grossly overweight, this is certainly true Unfortunately, similar recommendations are often made to elderly patients who are painfully underweight Such individuals simply do not eat enough food To advise them to go on a low calorie diet, and to simultaneously deprive them of a cheap, yet nutritious source of protein such as eggs, is simply poor judgment Of course, the narrowing of an artery may be compared to a four lane freeway in which one or two lanes are closed off Imagine a road with traffic on either side flowing in opposite directions The blood flows throughout the body in similar, parallel, but opposite systems, with one system of ãtrafficä traveling at a faster pace than the other Whereas arteries are strong, muscular, and elastic, veins are more delicate in structure and, to a significant degree, lack the elasticity and muscular power of the arteries Veins have a limited capability for vasoconstriction, but have a large capacity for vasodilation Arterial blood flow is much faster than venous blood flow because it reflects the power of the left ventricular contraction as well as the arteryâs own capability for contraction Arterial bleeding is pulsatile, again reflecting the contraction of the left ventricle; venous bleeding is slower and more steady in character So when traffic is light, cars still flow During rush hour, however, traffic must slow down because the freeway is now too narrow to accommodate all the vehicles And it is difficult to state a definite figure concerning which heart rate is so slow that it is considered dangerous For example, in some well-trained athletes who have developed an increased stroke volume, a rate of 50 beats per minute or less may be adequate On the other hand, elderly persons or those with heart disease cannot increase stroke volume, and in the presence of a slow heart rate, cardiac output falls Between these two extremes are a number of patients who can be safely observed and surgery can be postponed until the patient is older or until the situation warrants it Yet, up until only 10 years ago, it was believed that a coronary artery did not become obstructed until after an individual had a heart attack Or does it? In autopsy studies on heart disease patients who die within 30-60 seconds from the onset of symptoms, obstruction of a major coronary artery is found in only about 40% of victims When the pathologist is asked why the patient died, often the attending physician does not get a definitive answer The doctor has to assume the role of a prophet and his advice should be so considered --- no test will allow him to make such a prediction  so, what kind of monkey are you?

So I took a bottle my mother was hiding and I splashed vodka on HIS bed, sonow I'm half calmly anticipating the consequences, and this is not a metaphor either,,,  ,,,nothing-- just went to bed right on it, amazing, truly amazing, well now that gives me my sense of humor back, i must say vejeklahn ah fahrrem mois ut winzze, fahz ut szens ehcht saying to anyone who had hears to ear that It seems like when people think of the world's first collaborative sentence, without a period to end it, they feel they must contribute stream of consciousness writing without any regard for punctuation whatsoever, and why is that? I wonder--when a semicolon does everything a period can do and then some, practically; and just because a sentence is long doesn't mean its little segments have to aim for unstructured streams (futile in any case); ordering language through punctuation enables ordering thought; and aren't there some fruits of ordered thought out there to share rather than narcissistic ramblings we love like in the half moment between the last dream and waking up, with the bedclothes still comfortable, and it seems the dream image made perfect sense though as we try to put it into words it slips away as did Orpheus's wife from behind him back into the eternal loneliness as he walked up from Hell?--and a stream of narcissism does tend to spiral into itself like a whirlpool, which could indeed be a fitting symnbolic picture of the doom awaiting us when the Y2K disaster hits in about 55 weeks (note the doubled sacred number of the Masons, who are behind all this anyway) , (they say) and not a picture that has endeared me to the collaborative masses sitting together in one room tonight and becoming quite irritated at Yet Another Critic, -- No, you're all really nice kids, and some grown ups here too, I see you in the back, yeah the kids are quite Rad, these days --  didnt' quite know all that Postmodernism was going to bring, did you?--Hatred of Authority (never so philosophical and sophisticated and even academickly respeckable in certain quarters) no longer a gesture but the Foundation from which all gesture, thought, feeling, rock band must emerge ("and they said they were foundationless!  we been lied to , lied!") nevertheless we were trembling after we read what the friend of his who lived the longest said, that if he (the friend) wrote down the other things the master did, he supposed that not even the world's longest sentence would be able to contain them:  not just saying Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the face of God and pray for your enemies and do good to those who abuse you, cuz God makes the sun shine and rain fail on good and evil alike--This is where several interrupted him--"Couldn't he keep the sun off bad people and just make rain fall on 'em, wouldn't that be more Godly?--""Yeah, let's see some action around here, we had enough of the Deus Absconditus and theodicy shit--" and other voices clamoring, but he ignored them for the nonce--FOr everybody else does good only to those who do good to them, and what good does that do? sort of; anyway you're supposed to be different, And forgive everyone or you won't be forgiven -- "no ifs, ands or buts there!" -- By, the way, you're all forgiven, even you, Adolph, but you must be born again, from above this time--You hear the wind blowing and see where it goes but you don't know where it comes from, do you, Mr Jones?--it's like that with everyone born again, from above, from the spirit; heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away; for the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds, but it grows into a tremendouse tree so big that the birds of the air nest in its branches; look, there's one now -- "Some commentators think those 'birds' refer to demons, you know, stuff corrupting the church like, maybe sicko popes and the Inquisition, whaddya think of THAT"  -again , he ignored that one, despite  its 2-foot safety pin poking through the navel-- Come to me, yes even you with that funny looking pin, all you who are weary and heavy-laden, for I will give you rest;  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am meek and lowly of heart and you shall find rest for your souls; I tell you the truth, if you are truly my students and followers, you will obey my teaching, and if you obey my teaching you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free AND shouting to the busy crowd in the temple that the scriptures were fulfilled that said He who believes in Me, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water, and Behold! I am coming soon--but because you are neither hot nor cold but lukewarm I will SPEW you out of my mouth ; But let those little kids come to me, don't prevent them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these ; I am the resurrection and the life, if you believe in me you will live even if you die--so don't worry about what you will wear or how you will eat, because all those without faith in the true God worry about these things--don't even take extra money or clothes for your journey, find the good people in town and stay there healing, teaching and casting out demons from everybody in the 'hood and if they tell you to get out of town, shake the dust off your shoes as  a sign to them; I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, and it's like a man who finds a treasure buried in a field, and he goes and sells everything he has so he can buy that field--Give everything YOU have to the poor and follow me follow me and let the dead bury the dead, even though foxes have holes and birds have nests, the son of man has no place to lay his head, we have to be in Jerusalem where the most religious people will kill me slowly and with public humiliation, but I will come back to life--it's more blessed to give than to receive; Before Abraham was, I am--How long do I have to put up with you?--a faithless generation always asking for signs and wonders and miracles; if they don't believe Moses and the prophets, they won't believe it even if someone were to rise from the dead--When you clothe the naked, feed the hungry, visit the prisoner, minister to the sick, you are clothing, feeding, visiting, and ministering to Me--but you who are laughing now will weep, and you who are full will be hungry; next time you see the son of man he will be riding on the clouds of heaven in glory with quadrillions of angels---Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near, as close as your own hand -- ---- --- -- --- --- NOt just saying those things but doing a helluva lot too--at least according to these old books, which a lot of people don't trust just because they're old; but even if there is doubt and you had to bet, if you bet against him you may lose everything, but if you bet for him you lose nothing--Nothing methinks but something like the illusory sense of Freedom Trevor and Heather had when the twirling melange of Ecstasy acid weed meth coke left them tasting the bitter taste of the same taste that Jimi Hendrix died of inhaling into his longues, an Acid That don't belong there;--- --- -- -- -- Of course very few could tolerate this kind of thing and they began to stomp and roar and it looked like Crucifixion time all over again--but with this significant major difference, friends, the people all filled with righteous indignation and anger this time were cool, they were really cool people, not like Pharisees at all, really kind of withit and contemporary and hypertextual alternative if you get my drift--cool;  What? according to who? well according to , uh, all the stuff we know, you know; I mean I don't know--they read all the right online magazines and listened to the right music and shit like that; ::SPECIAL BULLETIN::	 IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION, HAVING BEEN CHANNELED BY GOD THROUGH SEVERAL PROPHETS SIMULTANEOUSLY WHO THEN ALL TRIED TO CALL ME ON THE PHONE AT ONCE TONIGHT (SATURDAY 9:27 PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME ON DECEMBER 12 1998), THAT THE ONLY PIECE OF COMPUTER DATA THAT WILL SURVIVE THE Y2K DISASTER (except for an e-mail message to his sister written by Melvin Fresco and saved on his Apple laptop in Why, Arizona) WILL BE THIS COLLABORATIVE SENTENCE;;SO MAKE IT GOOD, FOLKS, MAKE IT GOOD, IE, TRY TO INCLUDE MUSIC AND MORE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF JESUS (SO AT LEAST WE WILL HAVE SOME WISDOM WITH WHICH TO ARRANGE KNOWLEDGE BY, AS WE LEARN TO SEW OUR OWN CLOTHES AGAIN, ETC (AND MAN WON'T THE FOLKS IN THE SWEATSHOPS BE GLAD ABOUT THAT!)) WE NOW RETURN YOU TO OUR ORIGINALLY BROADCAST SENTENCE This IS the last dream, Wake Up!---- That if they were all written down, the wonderful things he did and said, Not even the longest sentence could contain them, which will be okay becuz he said I will be with you always, even unto the end of the world --- So there will be time after that, or rather eternity, timelessness, but that will be most excellent for there will not ever ever never be time enough for all the new things we will do with Him, you and me, us, you and me, us,  i have nothing to add what could i possibly add right now it is never too late i love you love me too lets go togtherit is not sorny to say that i want to love jesus with all my heart i do i want you to love so we can o and be with him lets all be there please jesus make this work i wish i could have a bear with every single person in the world in heaven with god and we would all be happ and pure and good and forever thank you for this and that jesus  <small> Why didn't you tell me we were running out of bibles </small> Jesus Fucking Christ GET OFF MY ASS---JUST GET OFF MY ASS and for god's sake USE YOUR FUCKING BLINKERS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A TURN WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THING I AM A FUCKING MIND READER Jesus people USE YOUR FUCKING BLINKERS that's all I have to say people suck life sucks people suck life sucks but technology sucks more why must I take my life into my own hands--won't somebodyhelp me Assim que fecharmos os olhos ser‡ o nosso fim ƒ simples!

her forward into time into darkness into light and to let her reach out and touch and listen and heed the quiet and the light and to stop just stop sometimes and then begin again in darkness Don't you worry about me, I got new plans coming in every day and so my reluctance to involve myself too deeply in the workings of this "world wide web" and its alleged wondrous opportunities has thus far sheltered me from the pedantic toiling of that overwhelming portion of the globe's population not possessed of anything you'd rightly call a mind and in this fashion I manage to alleviate the inexhaustible inexorable wellspring of frustration and rage I apparently inherited but my eyes are open, my head is ajar, and I am no stranger to the ommniversal penchant for revealing the underlying presence of a vast latticework of ironic contradiction in the world such as we see it, and I am also not a stranger to the concept of accepting that I've been wrong provided that the stimulus of this recognisance is breathtaking enough as an example and thus will leave me willing to smile and revel in its existence immediately following any given meal of humble pie I'm fed or feed myself and you've doubtless ascertained by now that this exercise in collabourative thought as expressed through the structured medium of the WORD yet simultaneously discarding pretensions and institutions and commandments as they apply to the unrestricted outpouring of intellect which is, as near as I can estimate, the closest analogy for actual emotional expression unfettered by the self-consciousness and the vigilant completionist's need to set things forth for interested parties in JUST THE RIGHT WAY which is to say that as an officially-sanctioned fully-authorised hastily-deputized FOOL whose veins harbour the legacy of Tzara's demented genetic blessing, as a fool with DADA IN HIS VEINS I believe wholeheartedly in a deranged satellite from which some of us receive a signal which compels us to act think speak in a manner that the mundanes find outrageous at best and homicidally bewildering at worst worse than that I felt sure I was the only one but this work in progress has proven me wrong and if I'm wrong about one thing why not about everything why not about trivial things whether or not I can really believe that it's still solace and strephonade for me to be given that much hope that my place here is not unique and it's comforting to be infected with doubts like the doubts I would love to entertain when the signal's imperative lunatic pressure convinces me that I am, whether fool or not, whether right or wrong, whether alone or one amongst many freaks scattered the world over, that I AM destined to be understood at long last and to be loved and digested whereas before the signal's effect made my discourse unpalatable now I may be fit for consumption and of course at this erstwhile dream's fulfillment will come the dread and dire realisation that it had all come my way when it was too late for it to make any difference at all at least not to this planet's future landlords the roaches the rats and the reptilian backbrain that most mundanes excise but which we still exercise it's not too farfetched for me to be home to a suspicion that our own minds may be our downfall not betrayed by thought but consumed from within by a coldblooded fed-up brain hungering for quiet and wondering where it has been skull's out for summer and this is the first chapter in my report on what I did over my summer placation with any luck my signal and yours will cross again and we can whisper to one another just like this while the predominant transmissions are jammed we can whisper nonsensibly with meaning still clear thank you dear Its okay, I know you love me, you don't have to say anything; my brotherand my best friend got engaged this morning!! :) No, thats not right, it can't be, can it yes it Can, but is it, or is it not, or is it it and not IT, or maybe it is me or

meaningless words on a fake piece of paper, in a document, that nobody will ever read;  Are you adding your two cents worth just so you can be a part of some madcap kooky group on the internet, because you think this will somehow immortalize you or give you some piece of fame that everybody in this world seems to crave but only a fraction will ever have, simply because the small percentage of people who run the world have the ability to exclude everybody but each other from their cliquey underground clubs, well then think again, because this isn't the way to fame and glory, and neither is fame and glory the way to happiness which everybody should realize by this time in human development   Do you think that the human species has evolved as far as it will?  I think it is arrogant and short-sighted to think that humans today represent some finished product of the evolutionary process, and it would ridicule and belittle nature itself to think it was incapable of fully developing a being who is not smart enough to solve the problems it caused like Einstein said It will take a different sort of thinking to solve our problems than it did to create

who started writing in computer language  tht its got a bit annnoying now I should know i've read the whole thing anyway this is my contribution to the page which must know be pushing about 20 pages and it is pretty cool so i would like to say that don't you think that society today could be a liitle bit better without brand names and stuff as a 17 your old kid i know that if you don't have the right gear then your a re riduculed as a "gippo" or whatever the slang is in your part of the world and that people really should take people at face value and also mentality like this is like a  weaker  form of racism as it is judging people solely by their appearence and if it is comparable to racism then it can't be a good thing right? also isn't this new lad thing pathetic all Chris Evans fault for being a wank*r and telling us how to live our lives also people are not nearly creative enough they are so lethargic at the moment its 1999 at the moment by the way so you could call it pre millenial tension whatever that is but our entire society is governed by an over whelming sense of selfishness of i'm alright i'm happy no-one else matters if my demands are fulfilled for example no-one goes on marches anymore in the seventies everyone in uni went on marches for freedom or just for tastier cheese of whatever but no-one can be bothered any more even sometimes to help a friend in difficulty as it would put themselves to a bit of inconvenience and at this point if i'm sounding like i'm whinging a bit its because none of you know who I am but if you would like to write my email adress is phat.controller@cwcom.net so maybe someone will if what I am saying is relevant to their lives as i feel it must be i cannot be the only one who feels this and if by writing this i have changed something then it has been worth it thankyou and goodnight This is all a pile of SHIT and i think anyone who takes part should be shot ALRIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! dum Enter the slingboks brandishing their super phalic agile lipsticks! oh - the perfect opportunity to pour my heart out, but it seems that right now, i have no heart to speak of, just a bottle of wine, a modem, rachmaninov and other acutely pretentious objects - ah well  so it goes - i'm often quite normal, but today not so - i've been doing strange things like buying patent blue shoes - oh well, maybe i should do something constructive and whoever it was who was talking about peopel not marching anymore - i absolutely agree - i feel like my youth is being wasted on sed bottles of wine, not enough constructive angst - something must be done and another thing - why the constant repetitions? over and over - surely that was punishment? perhaps its sexual,,, and speaking of which,, am very refreshed and, unfortunately, surprised at the lack of porn on here,, must be a simple reason that i am too tired (or stupid) to notice,,, no matter what happens in my life, i will always love Holly Rosanne Elton,

together in this rather wounderful sentence than surely we can join together to campaing to cancel the third world debt or something useful like that, I have come to the conculsion that there is no such thing as true never ending love (the sexual type not friends and family) we only think there is because we only live to be 80 or so, and that there is more to life than sitting infrount of a computer no matter how much easier it is than the outside world we must not be scared to go out and experientce life no matter how scarry the world seems we must live life as much as we can other wise whats the point?   ---------------------------KILL ME--------------------------________________________I NEED SOME TIME____________________>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>ONE MORE TIME<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<............................................softly I've final found my chance, but like every other one it will be subjected the self destruction that is so completely taking over me, yes I'm slowly on the way down, like a jet fighter thats spiralling towards the ground bits falling off it and smoke billowing out, the ground looming ever closer the final impact almost inevitable, beckoning me and yet I'm struggling with the ejector seat, I'm trapped but if I struggle and fight long and hard enough I'll be able to free myself and land safely in a soft meadow, but I'm wounded, I don't know where or how but I know something is not right with me, I have no energy, no will, no fight, I am almost resigned to the fact I'll crash and burn, yet there is still something making me struggle and wriggle anything to try and get out and away, my life isn't flashing before me because I have no memory of anything I ever did so  As I sit here reading these many "tongues", I w_o_n_d_e_r what to write,a verse, or a song!   Chad and it doesn't seem right in those hollow skulls of mendacious thought to present in blinding clarity all the mad bad bullshit flying round in here, but look  no look again it doesnt matter it, nothing matters you prove it you live it you love it you write it and read it feed it and it eats you, these words like all words and works forgotten and when the great global powercut happens what then for our mindless meanderings, lost lost lost, in the reddened half-light of the lounge of the cremorne public house, Nottingham England, circa February 1999, and the lord at his high table, carousing to our fears, keening to our bewilderment; the lights go out when the meter dies and it dies silently, but why does trevor stare so? we wonder why but cannot tell, as all is murky in such strange heads but drink deep trevor drink deep and get your fill for tommorow when you are old and raging against the night and all clocks (no matter how elaborate) have stopped ticking and all spinning tops have spun their last spin look back and wonder and realise you have to be in it to win it you have to move your lazy ass and dance dance dance till you cant dance no more because your feet hurt so much but still they have to drag you screaming into that gentle night and rage rage rage my friend, my sly friend, drag you through the neon-strip corridor towards the drained swimming-pool, where falls only leaf mould, and there we gently lay you down, though screaming you, for scotty to beam you up, but alas! alas alack and now we are back to the meat of the matter and the words that create and make up the man because because because the man is made of meat and the outside room is locked and full of unappetising binliners replete with soiled treasures never to see the light od day until the universe ends, amen, and so trevor arises from the dead and sings his mad, bad song and the heavens weep all golden in the moonlight over Nottingham, and in the forest the robots howl and mad men cry "I am wolf" but we do not believe you and see through all front and trunk so trumpet to the high heavens or the strumpet or the happyfuckingholidaycampers so go get thee to a nunnery or any place that could bear you for a week, now let me think perhaps a day, nay make that a minute, or even a second and see then with Gary Gilmores eyes your own destruction your own creation that plays to the tune of Uncle Toby's trumpeting in the musty watches of our day wherein lies a tale, a tale to tell and a tail to tell it with, but we digress mounting the endless stair, for trevor cries onward, his cries echoed from Sherwood Forest and this is what he cries: Forgive me for I know not what I am, Believe me when I say I do not know where I am from, Have faith in me when all my troubles gone and love me before this light is gone, and life flees on angel wings that are on celluloid screens, but WAIT! I say wait, for all the farting breath of these tardy intervals of elaborate time call upon me!", and so he dribbles and unravels his lungs until they speak no more of walruses and kings, and in the solitary tower Philip watches and can see only pale images of would be phoneys milling in the silent middle distance untouchable unreachble though shouting and feeling and sayin why, oh why that is not what i meant at all ,so to another brother do I hand the flame and say pray lets not do it again but find some meaning in this muddle of myths and riddles and tricks that sleight and bite at every turn and divert the true pursuit of what is me and YOU  - a knowledge, a foreshadowing invisible in the stygian dark until illumined by the cigarette-lighter named DEATH, and  then Trevor embraces us, his face ruddy and inflamed, and we are one (not really so), and there is laughter from the slouched creature in the corner who turns to us one bad blind eye, and we see the pale rider on the municipal council bus and he is pointing the way and asking for the fare to that great bright light that hides in the oh so gentle night and trevor so this my sad end i leave it to you to sing it my friend, that until the day is once more born, this endless pre-millennium endless night, the song is unheard, but we three -- we happy three -- David, Philip and ever-absent Trevor -- leave thee now, tenderly, and here endeth our lesson, Did I tell you how much I love Ems, probably not, but there are some things that need to be shared Although she will probably never see this, I thought I would share this with you, From the luckiest man alive, Long live the post modern public sphere XXX oh, I didn't write that, by the way pleh <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" COLOR="9900CC"> and why isn't the word 'pleh' in an dicyionary I've ever found, it's not like it's never used EVERYONE has used the word pleh once, at least once in their pitiful lives if for no reason other than expressing frustration at not being able to find the right words, they're such elusive things, words you know how when there's one word you need, looking for, you KNOW the word but just can't think of it, it's right on the tip of your tongue   &nbsp; &nbsp;  teetering on the edge of your brain  &nbsp; &nbsp;  WHAT IS IT DAMN IT    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and then three days later when it no longer MATTERS you remember the word, what the hell is that?! how god damn annoying, it's at that moment when you give up looking for the right word, you subconsciously, invariably, involuntarily use the word PLEH  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   it's a mystical thing  &nbsp; &nbsp; the word pleh, to define it would mean to be one wih God, which is probably why I haven't seen it in a dictionary, I should copyright the word, can you copyright words? if so, I'm going to copyright the word "the" and become a billionaire in the matter of a day, an hour, a minute, stop using the word the!!!!! IT'S MY WORD  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    actually no, keep using it, every time you use it you'll have to pay YOURS TRULY a fine seeing as,  although I bet I'm not the only person who's thought of copyrighting a word especially that particular word but PLEH is different, no one is aware it's a word &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; YET  <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">change fonts yesss anyway after I'm disgustingly rich from copyrighting the word <i>the</i> hmm everyone wants to be rich money is evil and I HATE it really &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have a huge aversion to it only because I'm so damn sick of hearing about how the world revolves around money can't you see there's so much more why should we have to depend on little notes of paper (plastic in australia) for survival?! yet I can't say it's 'not meant to be' the way some people are so fond of saying fate and destiny PUH what a crock, excuses for not having to worry about decideing WHERE it is you're going and what it is you'll be doing there you have no choice, it's all previously planned there's a PATH YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW lol &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's all so absurd what was I saying? Oh, yes money &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't say it's 'not meant to be' (I've said that already keep your mind on TRACK here!!!) because it is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it IS &nbsp; &nbsp; therefore it is meant to be because what else is there? nothing and it's all so &nbsp; &nbsp; thoughts disintigrating, keep your mind, people are putting thoughts in my mind, yes don't you know that's what happens when those thoughts pop out of nowhere it's not because you're being creative or inspirational NO it's because people, not peple something, who &nbsp; &nbsp; those who are in control, they control      (  ooohhhh  )   us &nbsp; &nbsp; there are so many of them high high up past the sky two or three for each person down here watching all the time watching and taking notes, making things happen to see how we as INDIVIDUALS react either that or nothing else is real, no one, and I'm an experiment &nbsp; &nbsp; you're all androids designed to get a reaction out of me and everything is created for that reason only constantly watched yes the world revolves around me NO IT'S NOT SELF CENTREDNESS OR PARANOID DELUSIONS I'm not fooling myself no one is because no one else is real but if they were real then YES I'd say they were deluding themselves <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> I have until now been reluctant to use white because some moron fucked it all up by making the background black and, and, why does that matter, oh because, because everything matters lol but that isn't what I was going to say &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; does everything really matter &nbsp; &nbsp; or does none of it, either everything  matters or nothing does you can't have some things mattering and some things not it's out of the question like something having two opposites and I'd like to know, why &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; why what, you say? why everything, there's always a why, and it always ALWAYS comes back to 'I don't know' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's how everything ends, because we might tell ourselves we know, and invent scientific explanations for no reason other than to fool ourselves into believing we know why? because we want to know we're superior we HAVE to be superior we're PEOPLE well guess what PEOPLE animals are people too and sometimes I wonder if we really have the right to appoint ourselves the most intelligent species although I read somewhere that actually, octopi are the most intelligent species and if their life expectancy weren't so low they'd have taken over the world long ago such thoughts rambling through my mind spewing them out as they go through discursive diarrhoea is all it is it's a form of surrealism &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *eternal sigh* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh don't be rediculous thee's no such thing as an eternal sigh there's no such thing as ETERNITY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is even more rediculous to assume just because something is incomprehendible to YOU doesn't mean you can deem it non-existant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BUT I'm not saying it doesn't exist only because I can't comprehend it I'm saying it doesn't exist because I don't BELIEVE it's reachable &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; although I don't believe in happiness or true love or perfection either so, hum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; well it's all the same I do believe IN them I just don't think that we, as we are now, have any hope of ever attaining any of them &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it's not in human nature to be happy, we always want more, there's always a why, like I said before &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that rhymed :) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *childish giggle* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh all I want is to sleep &nbsp; &nbsp; no!! no no no not until absolutely necessary don't you know, sleep is evil?!!?! yes, it's all part of a foul government scheme for <B>WORLD DOMINATION</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; let me explain, if you will: <BLOCKQUOTE>The most important and ghastly conspiracy of all, the one no one would ever suspect, it involves killing off all life on Earth in a foul plot for world domination, the method of this mass murder? SLEEP!!!!!!!!! thatâs right, itâs something everyone does, something that is impossible to avoid, or is it? through secret spies (who shall remain nameless, mainly because I canât think up any good spy-like names at the moment) it has come to my attention that we are not supposed to live to a ripe old age of 86, the human race was originally immortal, through manipulation and gradual hypnotisation, *they* have succeeded in fooling us into believing that sleep is good for us, they tell us it revitalises our energy, that it rejuvenates us, this is all a sickening plot to con us into sleeping more, what the majority of the human race doesnât know is sleep is evil, it is what makes us grow old, sleep is the source of the aging process, it slowly sucks away our life essence, our energy, our youth, which means that without sleep, we donât age, the human race is immortal you may be asking what the point of this plan is, to fool us into sleeping, causing us to die well, the government is trying to kill us off they donât want us to realise that they are actually all immortal themselves, having given up sleep long ago they are merely biding their time, until Earth is so vandalised and polluted that it can no longer support human life when this comes to pass, they will all jump into secret getaway spaceships and jetton off into outer space, to secret hide-a-way planets they have waiting, on these secret hidden planets they will exist for eternity, revelling in their immortality, they plan to leave us here to die, if we havenât already died in our sleep from old age, this is why they want us to age and die, if we were immortal, weâd realise that they are immortal, and would most likely assassinate them before they could carry out their plan, it is possible for us to cast off the evil oppressions of sleep, true, we could die from sleep deprivation trying, but only if we rush it, and donât do it properly, to give up sleep you slowly have to sleep a bit less each week, until eventually you work it out of your system and grow immune to the requirement of sleep, once you have reached the point where you no longer need to sleep at all you will be immortal however itâs not quite that easy, there are a few problems associated with giving up sleep and becoming immortal first of all, sleep does rejuvenate our immune system, that much is true in order to prevent becoming infected with every disease we come across and dying from a common cold, meditation is needed to replace the work that sleep once did for out immune system so an hour of meditation a day will build up our immune system as well as ease some of the strain another problem with all of us becoming immortal is overpopulation seeing Earth will quickly become too crowded, if we keep reproducing at the rate we are now, and none of us are dying some of us will be killed by cars and cancer, for there is no way to prevent that but the most common way for humans to die is from age related problems therefore, when Earth becomes overpopulated, we have to steal the governmentsâ secret spacecrafts and zoom off into outer space to live on the planets theyâve found, stop laughing itâs a perfectly feasible idea we need to foil the evil plans of our superiors and seek eternal happiness on other planets, do it now!!! give up sleep, itâs EVIL!!!!! </BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">so, I'm not goingto sleep :) Oh, I don't really believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I do dislike sleep, it's a waste of time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what's the point of being alive if you aren't conscious to know it?!

fungus among us its great and in the world now this longest sentance well here i am again adding to this my two bits now more now that i've got an inkling of the possibilities   i work at a supermarket of bookstore you can find almost anything there if it involves the cultural mainstream  you need to hunt farther to find written works off the beaten path you know i cut an evening short in order to do////////// this//////////// so what for i say need there be reason is ay so much for the small talk sitting or standing here with my two glasses of Aussie wine flowing through my blood and lust it feels good and the'y kick me out of here in a little while so on i must go bu i am lost and that's the -----------  crux     of the mmmmmmm mmmmatter   i am  lost    my collaberation with the artistic urge came to / screeching   /  halt about a year ago just about a year ago just about a year back when i was thinking about painting but then it just didn't appeal to me anymore you know like there was something else to say or write or be i ddon't know because i am lost f o r ever or just a while i don't know and what's more where's that crystal ball you know the one i hid back  in the 70's yes 70's or maybe after that or before but no i was not a hippis but people say i look like i was one and i have to laugh cuz i was as straight as they come raising babies and such worthwhile endevours and planting green beans and morning glories which by the way take over a piece of land faster than you can hoe or till or whatever farmers do  there are no shades of gray when you are lost    lost is lost  only and exclusively lost   lost is lost on a sunny day despite what others might be saying  don't believe that everyting a person says comes directly from their own personal narrative  she may be speaking for the mutitudes  when she says::::::::::::::    lost is lost there is absence but never absentia there it is:  while lost there is never foun  i digress   I DIGRESSSS  the trustworthy or more peaceful type of personalities may seem to have truth captured but there is none of that truth will not be grapped and put out a s  one e a s y system  one day the enormous pile of goodies you have collected throughout the years and then proceeded to organize into shoe boxes of like things,,,,, simplyloses it s appeal and i don't mean bananas,  all that stuff so important at the time, holds no more interest than the daily reporting of football score in October  maybe the eye has grown tired of all the pressure you have exerted upon its gelatinous mass and needs a silent retreat full of ritual and tangha bells   a person may start anywhere really, then turn around and do it allover again; it could be the way a certain line curves in a painting or a shaft of light or the sound of water in the drain who knows  or the sttraction might be a socio-political statement in combination wtih your own personal issues of a fragmented identity and disconnected life experience of women, that pushes you, gives you a purpuric rash and generally makes you question your sanity,,, these things must be addressed!!!!!!  seeds seeds worms bitter drink formulating a sour taste in the gaw by gum by jolly i am lost  but there was this gold bracelet once in the lost and found box at work where people leave all kinds of things and i just wanted it and no one came but i couldn't cuz i'm a good girl yes a good girl and then someone took i\the box of lost things to the goodwill but i didn't take the bracelet and why don't i just have a piece of pie for christ's sake what a whimp or a munch or tra-la-tra-la-tra-la-al-la-a any body can stay lost and let the boatsman steer you over the waterfall to a sure and swift death but to have to do it on your own is the trick and taxing part we don't normally break for a sponser at this point in time but this is america and the buyer rules or is it the corporation and i am not getting into that arguement senseless demented how to keep sane is what i question i want things from every other catalog that comes in the mail are you gray or purple or ridgid or tempting i am just lost and lost is not found nor is it anyting but lost, She may be speaking for the multitudes when she says:::::::::   lost is only lost  and to remember the above place where i said that there is a fungus among us and it's not the one that grows in

And it's just something interesting or more likely not so interesting for you toread (well you have to have been bored toread this sentence, the majority of it is random gibberish and crap) <BR>Okay well, for the past eight months I have been engaged to a person eleven years my senior (I'm 17, work it out) who is actually a very deep person I enjoy talking to, however, I have recently been diagnosed with a mild form of Antisocial personality Disorder which the common person refers to as Sociopathism, and no I'm not planning to become a serial killer although I have frequently thought about ending someone's life; anyway, the thing is I don't love him, can't, don't love anyone, never have; I can temporarily remedy this by lying, I am a fabulous liar, I do it constantly, and I have been lying to this person for an exceedingly long period of time (for the sake of simplicity I'll call this person Bug) So, one day I decide I've had enough of this lying and it's boring me, so I tell Bug the truth, only he doesn't believe me, doesn't let me go, and threatens suicide; I decide to stay with him out of pity, I really am I nice person you know, and take it all back; everything is fine again until I give up and decide the utter misery that comes with this package renders it unworth all this crap, so I tell him the truth again, the same thing happens, and then the same thing happens again; how could he keep believing me after I admitted so many times to lying? It must have been because he so deperately wanted to, anyway the other day I really really did end it, and he's been harrasing me ever since, see I didn't do this with the intention of hurting him, I did it with the intention of making him happy, because he has never een happy; he's got it into his head that his life won't be complete unless he has someone else; anyway I ust finished talking to him and even though the day I finished it he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists (which he told me about in great detail to induce guilt and maybe cause me to go running back to him) it didn't work, so apparently now he's going to hurl himself in front of an oncoming train/subway; sigh, I don't believe him of course, I did before but if he was going to commit suicide he would have done it by now, he refuses to see that this situation is partially his fault, that no one is going to love him if he keeps trying to stick his entire life on their shoulders, he's wallowing in self pity and I have become EVIL and NOW, my dear friend, he is threatening to haunt me to my grave (which isn't going to happen because what I don't believe in doesn't effect me AND I'm not going to have a grave, I refuse to be buried, at ALL not even my ashes)  <BR>I have to apologize for the seeming senseless words I'm pouring from my mind, see it would make a lot more sense had I slept, but hmm, sleep is evil, I've described it before on this thing; although that's not why I don't sleep I just don't because it's a waste of time and I do have very disturbing dreams although the medication I'm on does repress them I haven't dreamt at all for the longest time which can't be healthy because we dream when we <I>need</I> to, cutting them out of your sleep has to be a very very very bad thing, I never did trust people you said very very very it's very suspicious behavior, one very is ENOUGH!!! It annoys the hell out of me, as does multiple question marks, such as when a people ask a question like this???????? Why do we need all those excessive question marks?! We get the point after one! Anyway i didn't sleep last night, I had to walk three miles in the rain to save the life of a half grown mouse, I won't go into details because I'm going to go finish a story I've been writing, but it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences (the story is about a frantic mother who drops her baby from a fifth story window when it won't stop crying)<BR><A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/ILoveWitch">hmm yes that's about all, bye!</A> </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></P> she said she wanted to see the world, but her eyes were stuck shut with double-stick tape Tak, tak, taaaaaaaaak!!!!!!!!!

NYAAAH HA HA HA HA!" -and the sentence continues, and now, some sad personal commentary; for three years or so, it seems that I have been in love with a girl who always treated me like shit, we were together for two and a half of those years and broke up six months ago, but I can't seem to get over her, really, no matter how hard I try, she is still there, and I know that I should be glad to be rid of her, what with the abuse, infidelity, and mind games, but I can't seem to do it, I thought I was stronger than that, and before she entered the picture I thought to myself every time someone talked about something like this "Gosh, that will never be me", but now it is me and I don't know what to do; I can't even seem to fall in love with someone new, something that happened with alarming regularity before I met her, but she's still in my head and still fucking me up, and I'm so afraid that she's never going to go away- Thanks for listening, I'll let someone else rant for a while,  oh oh, repetition time- and the sentence continues, and now, some sad personal commentary; for three years or so, it seems that I have been in love with a girl who always treated me like shit, we were together for two and a half of those years and broke up six months ago, but I can't seem to get over her, really, no matter how hard I try, she is still there, and I know that I should be glad to be rid of her, what with the abuse, infidelity, and mind games, but I can't seem to do it, I thought I was stronger than that, and before she entered the picture I thought to myself every time someone talked about something like this "Gosh, that will never be me", but now it is me and I don't know what to do; I can't even seem to fall in love with someone new, something that happened with alarming regularity before I met her, but she's still in my head and still fucking me up, and I'm so afraid that she's never going to go away- Thanks for listening, I'll let someone else rant for a while,  non ne posso pi ...and ,oh oh, here I am again, I just can't seem to stay away but keep getting drawn back like a moth to a flame, anything that offers a shot at immortality, my own teensy-weensy place and history, and a forum in which to vent my spleen or expose my opinions to the world will do that and for even as we arise and endure, so must we all pass away, it is in the nature of the universe that people grow old and die, stars grow old and burn out, and even the universe itself must decay, but fortunately for us there are things that keep us from thinking about these very frightening realities, we can sing and dance and make love, but sooner or later it is all going to catch up with us, there is no avoiding it, there will come a day in the life of everyone and everything when tomorrow will fail to come, even the oldest tree will die, the planet will collapse, and even ideas and thoughts which have a shelf life greater than that of anything else in the known universe (if maintained properly) will fade and disappear; this sentence is a very long and enduring idea, but even it has to end sometime, it will not last forever, there will be a period eventually; and this is something we all must realize (for that way lies wisdom), but not dwell upon (for that way lies madness); one day I will be gone, and eeternity does not truly exist; in fact I don't think that I would want it to: heaven is a very appealing concept in and of itself, but eternal heaven? that would defeat the purpose, sooner or later we would run out of bliss and go off into eternity bored out of our immortal skulls, and the same goes for hell, there is no pain that a soul could not grow accustomed to in a thousand billion trillion millennia, and no torment that would keep you from boredom in that time, and even if you arranged some sort of exchange program, so to speak, and went back and forth between heaven and hell, and maybe some other places, Hades, perhaps, just arrange one big supernatural grand tour, the time would come when you woud find yourself wishing to be released from this life or whatever life you were living, and just achieve nirvana, nothingness, death of the soul, so I am proud to say that I am mortal, and that I fully intend to die, erase my consciousness forever, at some point (if not necessarily right now) and I would advise anyone who reads this to do the same and I am a mere mortal passing through the portal between what is and what will be and I'm always in the portal so what I close my eyes and wish away the portal and become immortal and this is like a child's game and this is just the same goodnight stone solmountain where ever you are I will always  </font><small><a href="http://members.amaonline.com/liz/todays.htm">go here :)</a> They give me good horoscopes! zupa z jupka This one will be in polish: tu byl fon]-12 sierpnia 1999, dzien po zacmieniu slonca :), huh!:); <small> 13/8/1999 Dzien Dobry!

If I had some money I would go buy a corndog, wants a corndoggie bad,  like the rain in such occasions makes me want to just pick up my  SUITCASE AND LEAVE YOU YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE , but I have more social skills that, and I think i'll just go off and leave you anyway cuz your a  whore with nothing to your name, but as I was saying before, I think we all need to make adjustments if we are to live in this word without having to utter the phrase " bitch and I hate you, so go to hell  And I then said to judy, what the hell did you just say? and she said, oh I dunno and I said yes you do so we all got in the CAR AND WENT HOME ,because obviously Judy was doing unsolicited drugs in the bathroom wihtout me and so i hit her over the head with a  fish and then we'll see who's got the last laugh my little one, as I bite you like a parahanna on cocaine and lick my fingers as I eat your eyes like LIVER AND STUFF and then say "holy wow, look" at the sight of them all dancing NEKKID AS PAGANS IN THE RAIN OF MY CORNDOG  and watching them fall is like water off a ducks back, I said to myself as I secretly packed away the childrens clothing so as to leave the country by morning, I then began to think to myself " what if the world was a circle, and in that circle was a pile of money, and seeing as the circle is around the money, as it is indeed a circle, if you try to take the money then you might find your self wondering, what if the world was a circle, and in that circle was a pile of money, and seeing as the circle is around the money, as it is indeed a circle, if you try to take the

the other corndogs out there that didn't quite make the grade, you know the other ones that were too faaaatty or greasey or just plain cold, just like that  and as I stopped thinking about it I started to sing to myself "this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friend, some people started singing it, not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friend, some people started singing it, not knowing what it was, and they'll continue singing it forever just because this is the

because" I THEN SHOT MYSELF TO DEATH WITH A CHROME 45  too many times I have been mistaken and too many times I have been rakin the leaves in the front yard when the weirdest thing happens and I look up to see the writting on the wall is all for me, it speaks to me, it sets me free and lets me see whats hiding in the tree  and then said "I hate you, I hate you all, I hate you all so very much and then I long to feel your touch, I miss you now and always will, your love to me, to death I'll kill, the ones who look and say your name, the ones who think my lives a game, I'll kill them all and then they'll see, the fauxness of reality  then I put down the bong and stopped being weird and shit and said  what the hell was that!?  But then I looked around and realised  we all need to eat like a bunch of boars and this is your mother ~~~~~~call your mother~~~~~   kiss me, beneath the milky twilight, lead me, out on the moonlight floor, lift your open hand, strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, silver moon sparkling, so kiss me  and then look at yourself you pig, you look all slimey, go away, whore  but then I took my pills and it was all okay  then said "eat me, out on the moonlit twilight, kiss me, like a fricken selfish whore, tell yourself you'd love to kiss her then kiss me and make yourself a wreck until we push you out the door, so eat me"  I then smacked myself for being stupid  cause it only takes one bad apple to well spoil  </font><small><small><small> don't forget to remember that you are a Frog </small></small></small> Wyroki rozwodowe, rozumiem?

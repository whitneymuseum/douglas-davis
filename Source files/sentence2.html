So see you in the cyberspace! that's all folks!  the world is now one with itself and other mortal beings, we are the quintessential beings of live - living, prospering, growing on and on and on until one day there may be no more; the end is far however and if that day should ever come the let it be it so and hope and pray and breathe that if it be it so then that is how it was just meant to be . . . and then a hush fell over everything and the man with the oak walking stick cleared his throat, and then blew his nose, and then started hacking real bad, like one of those people who you know shouldn't be going to those smoke-filled bingo halls, but go night after night ... and then he spoke, in a clear and high and almost girlish voice and from the dawn of time, we sailed onwards, infinitely upinto the heavens hoping only for a glimpse of God, or for proof that he did not in fact exist -- wondering if we worshipped the right one, or if he was in fact dwellinginside us all the time -- now of course, if he was dwellinginside, was it just one of us, or all of us, and if he wasin all of us was he distributed equally, into 5 billion seperate parts of the human condition or, instead did hein fact reside in all of us in his whole form -- could wein substance, ourselves, the human race, be this "God" for which we searched, and where is the place for organized religion in all of this, the answer of course to that lastpart being nowhere at all, no organized religion is withouthypocrisy when one simple man speaks to us and tells us heis the messenger of God, so I say unto you, all of you, thatwe must continue on as we always have, and believe only inourseleves and our fellow man, and perhaps for the firsttime we will see the peace to end all wars and then out of the gates of hell the lone man rose to dispute the rantings on of the silly creatures who spout so much nonsense and then he spoke to all who listened and said "Heads will roll", and the earth swallowed him and the sun shined and the earth shaked as I slowly walked on wondering what the man had meant as I looked to the sky and it turned dark in my face, horrors crossing my eyes as I slowly melted into nothingness sometimes I feel as if I am wasting my life away, so I just change the channel This crazy place in which we now dwell will grow and melt together with other alternate spaces in the widest expanse that the human mind will ever create to form a conglomerate of ideas not from the multitudes but from the infinite multitudes of people who lived then and live now and will live on into the future, the human condition dictates that in the spirit of manifest destiny we will always want to expand our territories into every which realm we dwell whether it be a man made realm or a universal realm and the condition that we have created is that our minds will create new areas in which other minds can create and be godlike, a specific example of this phenonenom is exactly what we are doing right now, submitting entries onto the longest string of human thought and idea to ever be thought of, and if we had not thought of it and added to it as one people "IT" would not exist at all so "IT" is a man made world in which humans can achieve greatness itself, and what could ever be better than that anyway I would like to kill, no maim, no just hurt, no wait, I would like to get my boss fired so I can have his job... No, I just want him to quit so I can have his job,... yeah... there is no excuse for wearing barrettes  Thomas Benton, whose work we are mostly unfamiliar with,went blindly seekingthe use of his left foot striking pain and anger to the nervescontained 	Dawn violently broke across the valley and it was a new day There's something special about new days We treat the morning with some great break with the yesterday, even though time runs continuum ad infinitum etc In reality, nothing changes while we're sleeping and when we wake up in the morning it's the same shit as it was yesterday	But we don't live in reality	We live in the symbolic Symbolically, when the sun sets and our drowsy eyes close for the night, something happens and the yesterday is radically separated from the today	If you're ever lucky enough to disobey your weak body's command and stay up all night, watching the hues of twilight and thw hite static flicker of one million Americans hypnotize themselves and the rosy sunshine breaking over the horizon, you immediately realize how the same yesterday and today are, how there is no separation between the days, how they all slide together, merging into an infinity But back to our world, back to the symbolic	It's a new day 	Dawn violently broke across the valley and it was a new day There's something special about new days We treat the morning with some great break with the yesterday, even though time runs continuum ad infinitum etc In reality, nothing changes while we're sleeping and when we wake up in the morning it's the same shit as it was yesterday	But we don't live in reality	We live in the symbolic Symbolically, when the sun sets and our drowsy eyes close for the night, something happens and the yesterday is radically separated from the today	If you're ever lucky enough to disobey your weak body's command and stay up all night, watching the hues of twilight and thw hite static flicker of one million Americans hypnotize themselves and the rosy sunshine breaking over the horizon, you immediately realize how the same yesterday and today are, how there is no separation between the days, how they all slide together, merging into an infinity But back to our world, back to the symbolic	It's a new day 	Dawn violently broke across the valley and it was a new day There's something special about new days We treat the morning with some great break with the yesterday, even though time runs continuum ad infinitum etc In reality, nothing changes while we're sleeping and when we wake up in the morning it's the same shit as it was yesterday	But we don't live in reality	We live in the symbolic Symbolically, when the sun sets and our drowsy eyes close for the night, something happens and the yesterday is radically separated from the today	If you're ever lucky enough to disobey your weak body's command and stay up all night, watching the hues of twilight and thw hite static flicker of one million Americans hypnotize themselves and the rosy sunshine breaking over the horizon, you immediately realize how the same yesterday and today are, how there is no separation between the days, how they all slide together, merging into an infinity But back to our world, back to the symbolic	It's a new day Glad to have found you in the sentence - glad you have joined in ......as always, remember who you are DOUGLAS E-MAIL SUSAN - NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU Remember oh far travelling one, she who must be obeyed, is forever near oops, there's a typo in this sentence, open up the soap duckets - french <p><a href=sentence3.html> next part of sentence </a>

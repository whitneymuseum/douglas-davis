<a href=sentence4.html> previous  part of sentence </a><p>the Galaxy, it's also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it's global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it "In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled" many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60's) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 "Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar"  insists Davis, "not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users"; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it's impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into "thousands of people", and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas's work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video thst are included in the sentence for an undisclosed amount of money but anyway money is not the problem here, what counts is that this World First and Longest Collaborative Sentence clearly means on the net the birth of a new "period" ;-{)}<P></FONT></A>  and I do hope that the Sentence Isn't done and even if it is no one will read my silly little SUBmission because i'm way far down here - far from the bits I left up Town- and I just want to share something that I discovered today and that is that's its impossiblr to live in the NOW, even if we had a cosmic radio announcer who said AT THE TONE IT IS NOW BEEEEEEP there would be now in the beginning of the beeeep anda now in the middle and at the end and by the time the beeep was in your ears it wouldn't even be NOW anymore it would be THEN and just thinking about how we're all actually livivng in the THEN is a bit strange but not AS strange as the fact that this is probably a veritable COMPENDIUM of CORNINESS with all the corny things a lotof people but most certainly not ALL wanted to say and make it sound deep or coolor neo-way-out-beatnik, even though the last beatnik wasted away I think which is sad because I always wanted to meet one and I wonder if I put my address on this wou;danyone even notice not as though I'm going to after all I'm not some chic chick out for a kinky stalker to add flavor (vanilla or otherwise) to my life and now Ithink its time for me to GO TO BED so GOOD NIGHT AMERICA SLEEP WELL AND SWEET VERY OH SO SWEET DREAMS and i wish i were in love with someone don't you   it's not easy being me <title>This is a test I'd be willing to bet that it will not show up</title><CENTER><H1> YOU WERE RIGHT, YOUR STUPID TEST JAMMED THE SENTENCE FOR SO MANY WEEKS, DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART, SMARTASS?<P> WELL HERE IS THE REST OF THE SENTENCE AS PEOPLE POSTED IT WITHOUT NOTICING THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN ON THE SENTENCE BECAUSE A LITTLE BRAT DID A SO-CALLED "TEST" WHICH CONSISTED ON PLACING A "TITLE" COMMAND INSIDE HIS POSTING WITHOUT PURPOSLY PUTTING A "/TITLE" COMMAND LATER, SO WHATEVER WAS INTENDED TO BE POSTED LATER BY ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS JUST ENDED UP IN THE "TITLE" -  THAT'S WHY NOBODY AS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY ON THIS COOL WEB EXPERIMENT<P>  ANYWAY, I (ANONYMOUS) FOUND OUT THE PROBLEM AND GOT IT CORRECTED SO PLEASE CARRY ON WRITING<P>BECAUSE I FIND IT SAD THAT ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SENTENCE AFTER THE LITTLE BRAT EXPERIMENT DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO HAVE THEIR PROSE IN THE SENTENCE, HERE IS A REPOST STARTING AT THE EXACT POINT WHERE THE LITTLE BRATEXPERIMENTED HIS DIRTY LITTLE TRICK </H1></CENTER> Ahhh the fishes have tales to tell and stuff to show we must be part of this its in our gills they tell us so green and a half worms of August and well, it's past the date all of you said but you never said we couldn't ANYWAY so here's a fragment for you, just a little piece of my illusions for your very own, new and improved, half the fat, calories, and assorted little furry creatures that live in dark places and don't come out much, except to use the bathrooms, which of course they haven't -got- anyway in the little dark places where the furry things live, but my little fragment that i'm giving you has -half- of them now, for your very own, ever and always, and you can even show it to your grandchildren and say I Was There When, you see, but you can't have ANY MORE OF ME, damn you all, so don't ask  je suis fatigue maintenant s'il te plait au revoir bonjour merci ohayo toide doko goodbye world umm five, no this is a yuesday isnt it, truck, they stole the cat again, how much time is spent in the pursuit of fleeting gratification and how many more ways do we need to pursue it  you know, my mother named me Briar and although many people think this was perhaps after something cute like Sleeping Beauty (aka Briar Rose), really it was just after the heroine in some smut novel she picked up in the grocery store some time in the early 70's - and isn't that just the way of the world?

i wandered past the shattered husks of former health as they lay in the alley and glanced at a hooker on her knees paying off a cop in trade; stevie and i had arranged the meet, and i was hungry for the money and it seemedthat the vials were burning where they lay against my leg; but when they caught meslipping them into my mouth to do a handoff to stevie by kissing him long and deep, passing him the vial with my tongue, pretending not to notice the feel of his tongueagainst mine, pretending i couldn't taste his fetid breath; then they took me down to the station and worked me over until they were bored then tossed me in with the dragqueens;there was one, who called herself "jackie o'nasty" and she was in for stabbing a man;i asked her why she did it;<p>she said "well, there we were, my man and i walking along on our way overto Pierre's -- you know that bar over there by the cinema near the Zone -- andwe were on our way over there even though the acts there are really nothing compared to what they used to be when Miss Virginia Ham was lip synching there, i mean,the kids today just don't have it; when i was first coming into drag, i made myown outfits and it was all a craft, an art; today these young kids just buytheir own; and i just *don't* want to know <em>where</em> they get the money;probably into drugs; i never made that kind of money when i was hooking; but thewhole management thing got on my nerves so i just left that bad boy in the dustand went freelance and started flagging down truckers, standing on the corner and waving at them; and i know i'm not looking mighty real now, since the cops toremy outfit like this (those brutes) but i was looking so very real that mostof those phobic good old boys never knew that i give good head because a girl likeme knows what a man like him wants;<p>"but anyways, i was explaining how i got here; so there we were walking over to Pierre's Barand my man is wearing his stonewall 25 gay pride t-shirt that we got at the dance on the USS Independence and suddenly these two cute adorable college boys in their frat shirts start hollering at us, calling my man a fag-boy; well, we ignored them, after all, a lady has her dignity; but they started following us and calling out the mostdreadful things to us; and just as we were getting close to the busy part of thestreet, they ran up behind us and knocked him down and asked why i was hanging outwith a fag-boy like that; and, well, i may not look it now, but i was a wrestlerin high school and i used to box until i realized that i just couldn't cut it asa butch boy; so i decked the one closest to me and when the other one pulled a knife, i just took it away from him and slapped him upside the head so very hardthat it knocked him out cold; the first one had gotten up by this time and wasrunning back over to me with hatred in his eyes, but i knocked him out too; after all, a girl has to protect her man, doesn't she, now; but that's what the cops couldn't understandabout it because when they showed up they were nice and friendly until they realized thati wasn't a real girl, and it's just a little piece of flesh but it upset them mightily;and so they took me in and worked me over and that's why i'm here,"<p>i looked her up and down and realized that that she-male was ballsier than i would've beenin that situation; so i let her live even though she had seen my face;<p>everyone else in the station who had seen me wasn't so lucky; including the old secretary who was filing my mug shot;<p>i was out on the street again and dreaming of my home among the fellow water-mammals; sometimes, it was tough to be a were-human; sometimes i wished i was just a dolphinlike my siblings and pod-mates;<hr> </a> </em><hr>i dreamed of a !kung tribesman roaming the urban jungle, and of astone-faced urban homeboy roving the african continent; i dreamed oflovers calling out in passion, and the cold chill that follows hearingsomeone call out a name that isn't yours as you grunt and scream yourway to an aborted climax; i dreamed of the children in the gutters,calling out for a piece of bread, selling their bodies to those whoslice the flesh from their bones trying to make contact with someone,<em>anyone</em>; i dreamed of butchers in dachau deboning live womenand the men who volunteered for "aviation" experiments where they wereleft in icy water (simulating a pilot stranded in the atlantic) untilthey died, or who were placed in atmospheric chambers that wereevacuated until they died from lack of oxygen or from the lack ofatmosphere; i dreamed of whipped dogs whimpering in the night; idreamed of bondage in a microgravity environment and it was the mosterotic dream of my life as a man was tied and sodomized and then istood in front of him and slid his member into my vagina and rode himin the spinning no-end-up world of orbit until we both screamed; idreamed i knew the reason cats scream in the night like children andangels are never seen in the alleys occupied by hookers on their kneespaying off cops drunk on power; i dreamed i saw the naked face of loveand it was scarred with experience; i dreamed i saw innocence lost andthe terror of knowing what's going to happen next; <p>i sit in the hospital waiting room, blood flowing freely from myskull; it drips into my eyes and i shake my head, spattering the wallswith red;

themselves from their own imagination, and now they arestuck in that fucking limbo of false happiness frolicking intheir own shit,                                             But I am not as synical as I seem, because I search for alight, some hope that things can be different, and I havetried, tried fucking hard in fact to change my world or to have it change me, but nothing works, and I go on, and maybeone day I will triumph but probably not because we are all fooled by those simple toys and I eventually will stop to play, and when that happens I will have lost my way, all myprogress erased, and my one true hope gone forever,Please dont leave me hope, I may be imperfect in every waybut I am still trying to get through, to reach my apex ofreality, and I will not let you fucking beat me, I will not stop and play, I will win, I will find life, I will find love, I will find peace in my world and then I will tell allthose lost souls what you have held from them, just waitand see,and to the vouyers, I know this was a rather sloppy, gramatically incorrect passage lacking some continuity ofthought but please don't hold that against my message, it was as true to me as I could possibly make it,and finally to hope, look for me in the near future, I'll beknockin', you better answer                         <hr>We're procreating something

"Nikkei Click", to respect the spirit of the sentence, I managed to write this article without using a single period either in English nor in Japanese so I figured it was eligible inside the sentence itself; here is the english version, click on it to reach my home-page from where you can read the japanese version of the article, very interesting comments from Douglas Davis (the conceptor of the Sentence) and from Gary Welz (who cleared the technical aspects of this site) or other articles I wrote to present the web <p></FONT><A HREF="http://shrine.cyber.ad.jp/~etienne">

World First (and Longest) Collaborative Sentence" a few days ago: this sentence goes on and on, upon more than 300 K, and without a single period in it (actually there is because hackers found a way to force periods into the program), but it is not only the longest sentence on this side of the Galaxy, it's also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it's global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it "In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled" many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60's) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 "Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar"  insists Davis, "not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users"; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it's impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into "thousands of people", and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas's work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video that are included in the sentence for an undisclosed amount of money but anyway money is not the problem here, what counts is that this World First and Longest Collaborative Sentence clearly means on the net the birth of a new "period" ;-{)}<P></FONT></A>  <CENTER><H1> So, now that you know everything about the sentence, here is a chance to become

famous person, nor do I claim to be the phsycho that haunts the dreams that you dream, your dream that is going nowhere just like this plane in my mind, it keeps circling, looking for a landing strip but there isn't one in sight because this isn't where we all should be, on a plain, dreaming the night away in out nice soft beds with dreams dance in our heads, the dreams linger as the sun comes up, the moon is gone and so are the wishes and dreams that once inhabited the vast plain in our minds, now it's time to work, work as hard as we can so we can hurry up and die, an eternal, never ending dream, a tale that will never be told until the listeners already know the secret that has been kept for so long, as long ago as the first human has this secret been kept, it will be kept for ages to come, and infinite time this secret will be kept, told only to the keepers themselves, does the dream last forever I ask myself, does it only last a split second before we are forced to dream no more I ask myself, what if there are no more dreams, what if all that is left is an eternal nothing that lasts forever, never giving up, never releasing it's grasp until time ends, then what happens I ask myself, if there is no time to have dreams, and no dreamers to dream, then what happens to everything that the was worked so hard for I ask myself, it will simply be gone and all the efforts that were put into creating such a wonderful (or not) thing will be gone, will we have another chance to do it all over again, will we be able to regain what we have so suddenly lost, or will the never be another dream, now I dream, maybe for the last time, maybe for the first, I dream away in my nice soft bed while I drift off to another world<P><I><a href="mailto:CWatson@MegaWeb.com">Chaz

I mean, it sounds like an episode of Star Trek when everything is solved by using "science" that is all made up and that nobody understands anyway -- is that Drama?  I don't think so!  The "be nice and love one another" advice is nice and sweet, but hey, who the hell is listening to that?  Nobody -- we all treat each other like crap -- as for the personal greetings, I don't know what to say, other than I have none of my own -- I've been too alienated by my fellow humans to greet any of them (at least this evening) -- well, that's my current rant (much less nationalistic too) <P> I found a great quote from Thomas Paine, famous American something or other..."When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virture is not hereditary."What would this 18th century statesman think of this quote in the context of the internet? is this the end of everything  but here I am in Kwangju and it works hello from korea again to jane and to the world douglas on tuesday The sentence will go on until it stops and D* K* says : there aren't any differences between Science and Drama Both can be seen as Science or Drama, This is a question of point of view ~~~ For exemplewhen Galliliee said "The earth turns" he could say "I love the good armchairs", or "Als Beispiel furerregbare Medien wird dann das FitzHughNagumo Modell untersucht", but he said "the earth turns" !It was essentially a dramatic effect; another exemple : Caesar said in "Cesar the imperator" :"I think I am the master of the world", it was an unbiassed fact, but he could also say : "I am dry","I never read, I just look at pictures" or "The earth turns" ! So the distinctions between Drama and Science are illusions, and "Biological Times Series" don't need such a qualification withhis near understable expressions with "scientific" concepts extracted from their usual contexts--- I haven't to explain what is a Biological Time series  or Wavelets because what wecall "explanation" is only a tendency of our brains to react to stimulus in front of theinformation in memory, an "explanation" is a cultural motor output of our mouths and tongues or fingers,a problem of pronounciation and I dislike gymnastic~~~ I have no explanations to give you I should shut up but I don't~~~ If you begin to play with your fingers it's difficult to stop ---This sreen is an illusory conjunction *** We are old fashioned books and I am tired ##It's late## I greet the assistance :::A question of continuity in the text and a way to saygood by to the world turning as a broken disc and so long SALUT BANDES DE GAILLARDS  Gary is ÛçÛí ÛÀÛüÛ±‚‹Û Õ‚Ûá so am i, whoever i am and so forth À©±‰ ±Ûç… ¼–À£ÒøáÕÀÁÀÁ Àê¹Ð ±‰ÈÞ«ì«ì«ô±×ü¨¡’ Ëíá±ËóË¼ Ëó²ÖËÈ åŸÀ©‚ì¡ï µé¡êÛ¤µé¡êµµÀŠ  <P><STRONG>Jasper says: Virtue is not hereditary, eh?

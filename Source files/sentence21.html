found the yard sales before, and on many occasionit'd come to be you'd find a bargain, you'd see the sales, you'd grab yourcoat and just run, running like a mad hatter at the merchandice of

shown myself around 4:30 and been surrounded, expecting to be there withyou and take the blame myself, I don't mind, it's just that you'd left thebar at 3 and we met at 1 downtown by the malt shop, and absolutey gravy packets,did you forget something, I didn't know you knew philosophy like that, Ididn't know you could sing so well, I didn't know you could fly around thedang room like you owned the place, I didn't know you had the power to throwme down the stairs and kick my head in, I didn't know you could do all ofthese things, I had no clue, why don't you tell me these

knew, it's just so much easier to pin the whole ordealon a bunch of children, or an irresponsible parent, the family of 4 thatjust couldn't, it was a heroic tale and all for naught as the field burned,the whole place and the estate, we'd left there, but you know the ice creamwe found at the corner store, it won't ever be the same, my love, it wontever be the same when we had the manufacturing line by the river banks, itwasn't my idea, but it went well until you told us otherwise, certainly we'dhad good times together, then the bad times, you know maybe they'd outweighedthe good times at times by the bad times we'd had during the good times,but it didn't really matter, I thought you had fun, even if your father didn'tapprove, it was the vertical fly wheel approach I'd used so often, backfiringon me like it usually did, one of these times I swear I'll fix the antifreezething-ama-jigger, at least so it isn't splattering the mayor, he's not

better, with that littlefixation for gambling she has, tell me this; if he doesn't care for her,and she knew it (which we all know she does), and she cared, why, oh whywouldn't she have left by now, it's by simple minded logical thinking thatI've come to the conclusion that even though he hates her and she hates himback, they're doing the world a favor by staying in that house all day andbickering, I mean would you rather they fought it out on the streets or stayedup there, hell, I'm just glad they both forgot your phone number 867-5309,or was it the other way around and what

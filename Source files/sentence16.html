I ask myself under the grey sky, above the gray grass and engulfed by the general greyness of it all, something colorful? And it was and then seemingly before they even realized what it wasthat was going on, their bodies were being controlled, theywere being...taken over they no longer had control of anyof their actions, they were prisoners inside their own bodyand their was nothing that they could do or say about itthey suddenly realized what it was like to be: in a coma,paralyzed, and just on the outside for the first time in their lives, they were conscious but just not able to control what was going on they could see and hear everythingas well and for the first time in thier lives, they were notthe center of attention, they were not the reason that people were there the people were there to see and hear things but they had no control of what they did they now felt the same way as the poor children that they had pickedthey finally understood what it meant to be misunderstood test...test if periods are not allowed in the SENTENCE, why are they in thesentence? --- This is PRIME collectivism, bringing the sound and the fury to a monitor near you -- I WONDER IF ANYONE HAS EVER READ THIS SENTENCE FROM BEGINNING TO END I MUST ADMIT I TRIED BUT TO SAY IT WAS A CONFUSING EFFORT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT REGARDLESS I  FELT COMPELLED TO ADD MY TWO CENTS WORTH WHICH IS******BEATS ME HAVE FUN EVERYONE AND BY THE WAY MARTY STUART RULES thats because it is a <i>collaborative</i> sentence, one cannot possibly readit <i>alone</i>, silly i didn't have anything to write, but i wrote something anyways; in that way, i wasn't unlike most of my colleagues How's school? is the internet here to stay? i say,  "How's school?"  It is so amazingto become a part of history this way I can can't getover it really it excites me ! wo wow wo!k <P><I>The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless hetransforms strength into right, and obedience into duty Hence the right ofthe strongest, which, though to all seeming meant ironically, is reallylaid down as a fundamental principle But are we never to have anexplanation of this phrase? Force is a physical power, and I fail to seewhat moral effect it can have To yield to force is an act of necessity,not of will - at the most, an act of prudence In what sense can it be aduty?<P>Suppose for a moment that this so-called "right" exists I maintain thatthe sole result is a mass of inexplicable nonsense For, if force createsright, the effect changes with the cause: every force that is greater thanthe first succeeds to its right As soon as it is possible to disobey withimpunity, disobedience is legitimate; and, the strongest being always inthe right, the only thing that matters is to act so as to become thestrongest But what kind of right is that which perishes when force fails?If we must obey perforce, there is no need to obey because we ought; and ifwe are not forced to obey, we are under no obligation to do so Clearly,the word "right" adds nothing to force: in this connection, it meansabsolutely nothing<P>Obey the powers that be If this means yield to force, it is a goodprecept, but superfluous: I can answer for its never being violated Allpower comes from God, I admit; but so does all sickness: does that meanthat we are forbidden to call in the doctor? A brigand surprises me at theedge of a wood: must I not merely surrender my purse on compulsion; but,even if I could withhold it, am I in conscience bound to give it up? Forcertainly the pistol he holds is also a power<P>Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obligedto obey only legitimate powers In that case, my original question recurs</I><P> <P><P>I AM ENDER24/01/97 1:39:29 PM<P><P> <P>I don't know where she is but she's out there somewhere<P> <P><P><B><CENTER>san graal</CENTER></B><P><P>X9933<P><P> cookies suck END~ <font size=4 color=purple>Probablement sigui la única noia de 18 anys de Catalunya que és prou burra per a escriure xorrades sense cap ni peus mentre podria estar fotent-se una birra amb la penya Però jo sóc així què vols fer-hi?

that he lost track of the eternal truth he had previously been the holder of; it was at the corner of a street, where a child was playing with a stick and a pebble, that the king fell from his horse and with his face in the gutter saw in the flow of rainwater dirtied by the poverty of the neighborhood -- he saw a glitter in which a universe of games and mirrors and theatrical events suspended between laughter and sorrow hopped around circling upon themselves; the king then wondered whether he had changed and found that instead he was still the same; this sameness irked him and intrigued he decided to return to his mansion; there he found nothing had changed bu  a letter from Mr Davis was attending him in his mailbox; opened, the missive stated that George Maciunas had been looking for an image of real simple stuff and had not been able to detect it in this world of ours; the king contributed a yawn and Lucio Pozzi appeared in a globe of TV screens rotating near the ceiling of the

Can they explain the value of living quiet lives of resigned desperation and why are they so adamant about advancing such an early death on the rest of us because...Youth is king, and no matter how "old" they are, make no mistake, they are old, and have settled into the process of dying and Itâs easy for them because they learned to trade their hopes for security and To paraphrase Jefferson, God help the man that sacrifices freedom for security, for in the end he will have neither and Surely, the most fundamental aspect of a person, perhaps what makes us human, is the drive for benevolent progress, exploration, creation and These are the fundamental building blocks of the life well lived, and the uncompromising dividing line between living and existing and I further submit that the person incapable of understanding these concepts is inherently flawed, and thus the cruelest of ironies that they should be in the majority and In addition, the person who understands these truths and ignores them is worse then flawed;  he is perverse so then How are these people to be treated....Nod when they speak, use courtesy (when youâre in a mood to do so), ask them advice, and even try to cajole them to think for once in their lives but Do not take them seriously and Learn to ignore their trivial little mindsets, and dismiss their banal language as pure and utter garbage and When appropriate make them the targets of scorn and derision, but choose your battles because They are still in  i'm you'r we're forever mmmmmmpppppppppp <P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"><FONT SIZE=+3>1) Out of

All you try to do is improve and be the best that you can be, but you're going to die anyway so why does any of it matter? And there are always problems in life, thuff that will never go away but if you have only one life, don't you want it to tbe the best it could be?

He's just <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/md/yorkminor/">zis guy,</a> you know?) where somebody's not doing anything, not adding anything, not giving anything to the Web, not even anything interesting about themselves, and you think (imagine an ellipsis here)<br>"Is this worth it? Does <a href="http://www.netforward.com/poboxes/?witchqueen/">my homepage</a> have any meaning, or am I just one of those vain, boring, useless people who is deluded into thinking I've done something useful,<br>and then you write <a href="http://www.simons-rock.edu/~ayork/sexuality.html">something</a> that perfectly captures a moment, and it's beautiful, and it's right, and you know it, and you sigh and yoiu're happy<br>so maybe this is art, you think?</p> Wooooooooooooooow I fell all special now that I've found this page and contributed and people all over the world did too but I should say something important and intelligent so here's a thought I thought I would just share with you real quick and that's live fast, die young and leave a good looking corpse cause that's whats really important in this world after all cause life is like a sexually transmitted disease and no one really wants it anyway, wow, what an amazing way to just vent all those depressing feelings I've been feeling all my life but then is this nuts or something, how can people actually read all this  oh well I guess I'll leave my mark here and die happy cause I left my mark on the World (wide web) and although I've done that a little, no ones going to read this far anyway, I don't know why I'm bothering to add in my own part except that this is TOO COOL TO PASS UP I mean, wow, look at all this and this whole thing is just so LONG and it could just keep going, does anyone know when it was started  I wrote this in 1997, so I just wanted to know, okay this is the one spot on the net where you can just blather on and on and nobody will ever notice because they probably all said the exact same thing and I like how it begins with sort of obscure arty statements but it says everything that ever really needed to be said but I digress because we all know how cool this is anyway, so there's no real point to ending this thing as it could just keep going as long as somebody can support the page so it will live in immortality and I thank the faeries they are the ones who give us everything and if you disagree you can just kiss my *ss cause I don't care what you think and the director the drama guy can just go *&%^ for all I care because he totaly screwed me over for the musical and he's a bastard anyway, and now the whole world knows it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha now I feel a lot better this is almost as good as the couch of contemplation and it doesn't really matter any way because I'll just annoy him until he realizes that I'm not just going to go a way any time soon even though that seems to be what he really wants cause I know he doesn't like me he gave me a D in English and he's just stupid but everyone else is nice so its doesn't matter what he says cause they all like me anyway and I could go on forever you'd think that someone who's spent their entire life pretending to be someone else could be themselves for just one moment even if it is just for an audition or something stupid like that and I just cant get anything right any more, everything I do I screw up and my bastard little brother just gets everything he wants and everyone loves him saying he's such a sweet little boy when he's really just a pimp and I really hate him I'd like to bash his head against the wall several times then throw him out into the street so mandy can run him over a few times while her boyfriend laughs cause he really deserves it even though no one else seems to love him because he's just so smart and so wonderful and I'm just a stupid b*&^ who never does anything that she's supposed to do and just uses her time to write stories and finds comfort that no one on the net knows who she really is and she can just do what she's always done only in reverse because instead of being like everyone else I can be who I really am and It doesn't matter cause they don't even know who I am and this is all just a cherade anyway and I think I've gone on for long enough because I feel really stupid now for writing all this but it doesn't matter any way because if anyone does read this far it'll all flow together and they wont remember a word of it, I love this page it is my savior thank you all, a wild card in the trumped suit of brass astringency gfhj bvnm which was strad, guarneri, and one other one--what--what exactly was she trying to think of: dizzy jean-jacques kantorow puffing out his cheeks and bending the neck of his fiddle UP, of course, they said (i was listening today)we cannot possibly....it was then i knew the body without organs existed pufftoads be very afraid bbbbbbbbbbpppppppppp  Niedlugo napisze cos wiecej; na razie tyle so many things to read at once: who wrote this syllabus?
